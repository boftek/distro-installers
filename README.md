# DistroInstallers
DistroInstallers are scripts to help you install programs easily

### Updating
So the current situation does not allow me to anyhow maintain those scripts.\ 
Since the scripts are very easy to make I suggest you making the scripts by yourself or changing the existing scripts that I made and customize it your way.

## Usage
You will need to grant the file permissions to execute and to do that,
use the following commnads:

For Debian based distros:

```bash
chmod 755 debian.sh
./debian.sh
```

For flatpaks:

```bash
chmod 755 endless.sh
./endless.sh
```

## Customize it
You can customize this scripts to make your own installers just like you would use
Ninite on a Windows computer
