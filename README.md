# Distro Installers
![mainteance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/no/2020?style=flat-square)

Distro Installers are simple scripts that allow you to intsall multiple apps at once.

* NOTE: However when a new version of apps does release they usually are on new links so they must be updated to install the latest version


### Updating
So the current situation does not allow me to anyhow maintain those scripts.\
Since the scripts are very easy to make I suggest you making the scripts by yourself or changing the existing scripts that I made and customize it your way.
\
I might revisit this project in future with something more modern and dynamic like Makefile or Ninite-like package.

## Usage
If you still wish to get those scripts and install them on your machine you can do the following.

### For Debian based distros:

```bash
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
chmod 755 debian.sh
./debian.sh
```

### For flatpaks:

```bash
cd /path/to/cloned/repo
chmod 755 endless.sh
./endless.sh
```

## Customize it
Like I said. Those scripts are reaaallllyy outdated. \
So if you wish to use one of those I suggest first updating the links to get the most updated version.
